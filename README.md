# Archon-Bot

This is a read me MD file for this bot. Thanks!

8.22.21 Adding a webhook for this bot. Checking updates.

8.28.21 Tested out some premade bots and was pretty impressed with the options out there. It is a lot of little bots though and I'd love to have an "all-in-one" bot that can do everything I need specifically for this server.
I don't mind my bot being public for others to use as a template for their server needs as well. Here's to hoping!

>> So restarted my bot coding from scratch through github, BUT it looks like my bot also runs at the same time and works at the same time with botghost so I MAY be able to have best of both worlds. We'll see if it causes the bot to crash. Huhuhu~
